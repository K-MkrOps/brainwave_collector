# brainwave_collector
This project demonstrates the control of a turtle drawing using brainwave data collected in real time.

The brainwave data is collected using a BrainwaveCollector class, which can be started and stopped as needed. The collected brainwave data is used to control the turtle drawing by mapping specific brainwave patterns to different turtle actions.

To use the turtle drawing control, start the BrainwaveCollector and then run the turtle_drawer.py script. The turtle will begin drawing based on the brainwave data being collected. You can adjust the brainwave-turtle mapping in the turtle_drawer.py script to customize the turtle's behavior.

To stop the turtle drawing, stop the BrainwaveCollector and close the turtle window.

This project could be useful for interactive art installations or as a demonstration of brain-computer interfaces. It could also be adapted to control other types of graphics or animations using brainwave data.
